           'heating water and living spaces within our homes to generating '\
           'electrical energy. Solar energy is a type of radiant energy, so '\
           "named for the vibrating particles 'radiating' from the sun that "\
           'we talked about earlier. Solar energy is sometimes called solar '\

  summary: 'The periodic table is organized like a big grid. Each element is '\
           'placed in a specific location because of its atomic structure. As '\
           'with any grid, the periodic table has rows (left to right) and '\
           'columns (up and down). Each row and column has specific '\
           'characteristics. For example, beryllium (Be) and magnesium (Mg) '\
           'are found in column two and share certain similarities while '\
           'potassium (K) and calcium (Ca) from row four share different '\
